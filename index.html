1. What does calling a function do?<br>
<br>
If you are going to ask the function to perform its task later, you need to give your function a name. That name should describe the task it is performing. When you ask it to perform its task, it is known as calling the function.
<br>
  <br>
2. What are parameters? Give an example<br>
<br>
Pieces of information passed to a function are known as parameters.
<br>
<br>
3. Values in functions have a name. What is that name?<br>
<br>
When you call a function that has parameters, you specify the values it should use in the parentheses that follow its name. The values are called arguments, and they can be provided as values or as variables.
<br>
<br>
4. What is the difference between a parameter and arguments?<br>
<br>
The names are the parameters while the values needed to calculate the size of something are the arguments. Parameters are basically the variable name and the arguments are the values assigned to it.
